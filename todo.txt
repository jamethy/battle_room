Running ToDo List
-----------------------------------

make circle object
make simple wall
make game with ball thrown at wall

For full program
    Add speed to animations
    Add networking code to networking...
    fix missing animation
    create commands
    create messages
    Create an exception scheme
    create menus
    Add saving configs

Maybe for fun
    Create animation pre loader that searches through cpp files for animations to load
        or just a hardcoded preloader
    Create a performance monitoring system
        Records times globally
        Track FPS and rate of other functions
    Add a cleanup file paths function in file utils.
    Split up common somehow

Persistent to do
    Look for // TODO in the code
    document everything
    test cross platform
    Remove unecessary headers

Ways to crash the game
    Create an animation with no frames
    Create a recursive resource file
