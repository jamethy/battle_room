Running ToDo List
-----------------------------------

For full program
    Clean up camera movement code
    Create server world
        Add time
    Implement multithreading
    get texts out of views
    Create an exception scheme
    Create intersection handler
        intersection base class
        intersections class implementations
    Find a better way to construct settings 

Maybe for fun
    Create animation pre loader that searches through cpp files for animations to load
    or just a hardcoded preloader

Persistent to do
    Look for // TODO in the code
    document everything
    test cross platform
