Running ToDo List
-----------------------------------
For full program

    add overlays
    camera
        move on edges
    gameinterface
        select object (to defend, attack, etc)
        select group of players
        select point

    fix background bounds
    smart camera
    grapling hook
    Add speed to animations
    Move object intersection to testable code
    Create an exception scheme
    path tracing for high speed intersection

Maybe for fun
    Create animation pre loader that searches through cpp files for animations to load
        or just a hardcoded preloader
    Create a performance monitoring system
        Records times globally
        Track FPS and rate of other functions
    Add a cleanup file paths function in file utils.
    use menus to spawn objects (map creator)

Persistent to do
    Look for // TODO in the code
    document everything
    test cross platform
    Remove unecessary headers
    check virtual destructors

Ways to crash the game
    Create an animation with no frames
    Create a recursive resource file
