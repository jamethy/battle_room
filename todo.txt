Running ToDo List
-----------------------------------

For full program
    Make a camera manager
    Change animation handler to get() implementation
    Create unique id handler
    Create an exception scheme
    Create intersection handler
        intersection base class
        intersectinos class implementations
    Figure out inputs
    Figure out multithreading
    Find a better way to construct settings 
    implement zeroPlaneIntersection

Maybe for fun
    Create animation pre loader that searches through cpp files for animations to load
    or just a hardcoded preloader

Persistent to do
    Look for // TODO in the code
    document everything
