Running ToDo List
-----------------------------------

For full program
    make sure all new stuff is documented
    Add read another file from resource file
    implement update function to world
    Add networking code to networking...
    Move cameraMovement to an abstract class and create implementations
    fix missing animation
    Create an exception scheme
    Create intersection handler
        intersection base class
        intersections class implementations

Maybe for fun
    Create animation pre loader that searches through cpp files for animations to load
        or just a hardcoded preloader
    Create a performance monitoring system
        Records times globally
        Track FPS and rate of other functions

Persistent to do
    Look for // TODO in the code
    document everything
    test cross platform
    Remove unecessary headers
