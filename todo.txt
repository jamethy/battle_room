Running ToDo List
-----------------------------------

For full program
    test object receiving
    Figure out multithreading
    get objects and texts out of views
    Drawing order
        sort by layer
        sort by z value
    Create an exception scheme
    Create intersection handler
        intersection base class
        intersectinos class implementations
    Find a better way to construct settings 

Maybe for fun
    Create animation pre loader that searches through cpp files for animations to load
    or just a hardcoded preloader

Persistent to do
    Look for // TODO in the code
    document everything
    test cross platform
