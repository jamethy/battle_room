Running ToDo List
-----------------------------------

For full program
    Need to handle inputs in order of view layer
    implement update function to world
    Add networking code to networking...
    fix missing animation
    create network command stack
    create commands
    Create an exception scheme
    Create intersection handler
        intersection base class
        intersections class implementations
    create menus
    Figure out sending camera commands from game interface
    Try getting two windows to run
    Fix pyramid calculation.. something is not quite right...

Maybe for fun
    Create animation pre loader that searches through cpp files for animations to load
        or just a hardcoded preloader
    Create a performance monitoring system
        Records times globally
        Track FPS and rate of other functions
    Create camera that tracks a player

Persistent to do
    Look for // TODO in the code
    document everything
    test cross platform
    Remove unecessary headers

Ways to crash the game
    Create an animation with no frames
    Create a recursive resource file
