# Main Menu Javascript Source

The main menu code lives in  battle_room/res/menus as the filse main.html, main.css, and main.js. Since it is built with react, the main.html file is small and rarely changes, so this directory builds the javascript file.


# Set up

`npm i`

# Building

`npm run build`
